## Installation
First, go to : [www.chartjs.org](https://www.chartjs.org).

Click on the big **GET STARTED** button then **Getting Started** (*on the left*).

This will show you an example of a chart that you can simply integreate in your HTML file.

To integrate Chart.JS in your file, use this at the start of the "`<body>`" : 
`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>`.

## Examples

After this, you can experiment with all the graphs available, but I recommend using the ones located in the **Chart Types** categorie, located on the left of the screen. There, you can find most graphs, such as ***Bar Chart***, ***Line Chart*** and ***Radar Chart***.

Here's an example of a ***Polar Area Chart*** and how to integrate it :

### The HTML :

### The JS :

### The result in a browser :

## Easier Method
In the folder ***Test Files***, I integrated said files *(in the example over there)* for you to use graph easily.

If you want to change the type of graph, refer to the [documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest) and all the **Chart Types** available and customise your graphs.

## For the user
You can interact with the graph by viewing it in a browser.

Doing so, you'll be able to hover over the area and see precisely how much of the attribute set there is.
